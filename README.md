# Why 410 is Better than 404 for SEO

When managing website content that has been permanently removed, it's important to handle the situation with a status code that best aligns with SEO practices. In many cases, returning a `410 (Gone)` is more beneficial than a `404 (Not Found)` because it reduces unnecessary crawler errors and improves the overall efficiency of your SEO strategy.

## 1. **410 Communicates Permanent Removal**
- **410 Gone**: This status code tells search engines that the content is permanently deleted and will not be coming back.
- **404 Not Found**: On the other hand, a `404` signals that the page is missing but may be temporary.

If the page is permanently removed, using a `410` ensures that search engines like Google and Bing understand that the page is gone for good and don’t need to keep revisiting or re-crawling it. This helps eliminate search console errors that stem from outdated or removed content.

## 2. **Reduced Crawl Waste and Errors**
Search engines continue to crawl pages that return a `404` for a while, which can lead to unnecessary crawling and wasted crawl budget. This is especially true for larger websites with many deleted pages.

By using a `410`, you're explicitly telling search engines not to bother re-crawling the page, which reduces the number of crawler errors in tools like Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools. Fewer crawl errors mean fewer unnecessary requests and more efficient indexing of your site.

## 3. **Improved SEO Health in Search Console**
If a page returns a `404`, search engines will still keep checking it for some time to see if it comes back. This results in ongoing errors in platforms like Google Search Console. These errors pile up and can affect the SEO health of your website.

When you use a `410`, search engines acknowledge the page's permanent removal, clearing it from their index faster and reducing the number of lingering errors in your Search Console reports.

## 4. **Practical SEO Management**
In real-world scenarios, when a page is deleted, it is rarely intended to be temporary. For example:
- A product is discontinued.
- A blog post is permanently removed.
- A service page is no longer relevant.

In these cases, a `410` is the correct response because you don't plan to recreate the page in the future. Using a `404` is misleading because it implies that the content might come back, which is not true in most cases where the content is permanently deleted. This can cause practical issues and create unnecessary work by continually showing errors in SEO tools.

## 5. **Conclusion**
Using a `410` status code is the best choice when you permanently remove content from your website. It:
- Reduces crawler errors.
- Improves the efficiency of your site’s crawl budget.
- Helps clean up your Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools reports.
- Provides a clear message to search engines that the content is gone for good.

By using `410`, you save time, improve SEO management, and enhance your site's overall search engine visibility by avoiding the noise and confusion that comes with using `404` for permanently deleted pages.

**Choose `410` for permanent removal to keep your SEO efforts clean and efficient.**
